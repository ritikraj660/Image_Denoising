# Image_Denoising
Image denoising is a well studied problem in computer
vision, serving as test tasks for a variety of image modelling
problems. In this project, an extension to traditional deep
CNNs, symmetric gated connections, are added to aid faster
convergence transfer of high level information normally lost
during downsampling. Results show that training images, gated connections begin to make noticeable improvements in feature learning and image denoising.

Model used for image denoising is taken from mentioned Reaseach paper , Image Denoising with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks [ https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs331b/2016/projects/zhao.pdf ]
